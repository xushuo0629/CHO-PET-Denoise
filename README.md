* [BM3D](https://webpages.tuni.fi/foi/GCF-BM3D/) : [glemaitre/BM3D](https://github.com/glemaitre/BM3D)

* NLM

   We developed the NLM algorithm based on MATLAB, which uses integral image algorithm with memory optimization 

## Dataset
This was a retrospective investigation on a prospective CHO PET cohort which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) (ethics code ZS-2660), and informed consent was collected from all patients. Eligible criteria of the current study include: 

1) age â‰¥ 18 years and Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) â‰¥ 70;
2) suspected of having primary brain tumor and planned for surgery; 
3) underwent head CHO PET/CT prior to surgery; 
4) histopatho-logical proved that the brain lesions to be primary diffuse glioma; 
5) no anti-tumor treatment prior to PET/CT or surgery. 

Finally, 39 patients with pathological-confirmed primary diffuse glioma were enrolled for CHO PET/CT and included in the current study. The data presented in this study are available on request from the corresponding author.

## Network architecture

use U-Net as backbone.
